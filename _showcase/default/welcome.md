    <h2>Welcome to Showcase!</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
    I am a person who loves <code>life</code>, <code>travel</code>, and <code>exploration</code>.  
    Beyond research, I enjoy capturing the beauty of everyday momentsâ€”whether in distant landscapes or simple details of daily living.
  </p>

  <p>
    I believe this <code>curiosity</code> and <code>appreciation for life</code> also shape my scientific work,  
    inspiring me to observe, connect, and create with a broader vision.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am equally passionate about <code>sports</code> and <code>movement</code>,  
    which keep my body active and my mind refreshed.  
    This page is where I share glimpses of my <a href="#">journeys</a>, <a href="#">passions</a>,  
    and the little sparks that enrich both my research and my life.
