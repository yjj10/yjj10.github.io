  This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the latest advancements in parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)
  for pre-trained vision models, systematically reviewing methodologies and introducing the V-PEFT Bench benchmark.
  We categorize existing approaches into addition-based, partial-based, unified-based, and multi-task tuning, and
  provide insights into widely used datasets and applications.  
  The survey has already received **130+ citations** and the associated GitHub repository has earned
  **570+ stars**, highlighting its significant impact in both academia and practice.
