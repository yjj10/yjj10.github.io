  Multimodal in-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a key mechanism for harnessing the capabilities of large
  vision-language models (LVLMs). However, its effectiveness remains highly sensitive to the quality of input
  sequences. We propose **TACO**, a lightweight transformer-based model guided by task mapping, which dynamically
  configures in-context sequences via task-aware attention. TACO enables a bidirectional synergy between
  sequence construction and task reasoning, consistently surpassing baselines on five LVLMs and nine benchmarks.
  These results highlight task mapping as a valuable perspective for improving multimodal ICL.
