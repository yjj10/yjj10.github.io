  Despite remarkable progress in image quality and fidelity, text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models continue to
  exhibit persistent hallucinations where generated outputs subtly or significantly diverge from the intended
  semantics. We propose "Tri-Space Tension Modeling (TM-ARC)", which reinterprets hallucinations as trajectory
  drift in a latent alignment space. By quantifying semantic coherence, structural alignment, and knowledge grounding
  via a dynamic Alignment Risk Code (ARC), TM-ARC identifies dominant failure axes and applies targeted,
  axis-specific interventions. This framework reduces hallucination without sacrificing diversity or fidelity,
  providing a unified and interpretable approach for controllable text-to-image generation.
