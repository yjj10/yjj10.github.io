 <p>  
  🎓 I am currently pursuing a <b>Master’s in Computer Science (Global Transfer Program)</b> at the University of Bristol. 
<p>  
  🔬 My research interests focus on <b>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)</b>, <b>agents</b>, <b>Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)</b>, and <b>Continual Learning (CL)</b>. I am particularly passionate about building intelligent systems that balance adaptability and scalability while sustaining long-term memory and evolution. I believe these explorations form the foundation for advancing AI toward greater generality and trustworthiness.  
</p>  

<p>  
  🌍 My ultimate goal is to witness the birth of <b>true Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)</b> through research. I envision AI not merely as a tool, but as a transformative force that reshapes society—ensuring that technological progress genuinely benefits all. From access to food, housing, and clothing to improvements in education, healthcare, and social equity, I aspire for AI to help humanity move toward a more prosperous, equitable, and fulfilling future.
