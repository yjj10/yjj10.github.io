short_bio: |-
  <p>🎓 I am 21 years old and currently pursuing an <b>MSc in Computer Science (Global Transfer Programme)</b> at the University of Bristol.</p>
<p>🧪 My research centers on <b>reliable multimodal intelligence</b>: building and evaluating <b>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)</b> that can <b>reason consistently</b>, <b>reduce hallucinations</b>, and <b>quantify uncertainty</b> under challenging or missing visual evidence.</p>
<p>⚙️ Methodologically, I work on <b>efficient adaptation and deployment</b> (e.g., <b>PEFT</b>), as well as <b>continual / long-horizon learning</b> for systems that remain robust as tasks, context, and data distributions evolve.</p>
<p>🌍 I aim to advance trustworthy AI that is not only powerful, but also <b>transparent</b> and <b>useful</b>—so that progress in AI translates into meaningful social impact.</p>
