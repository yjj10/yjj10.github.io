  <p>
    I am a researcher in Artificial Intelligence, with a primary focus on 
    <b>multimodal large language models (MLLMs)</b> and <b>intelligent agents</b>.
  </p>

  <p>
    My research emphasizes <b>parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)</b> and 
    <b>continual learning (CL)</b>, integrating these methods into principled frameworks 
    for large-scale model development. Through this work, I aim to establish 
    training methodologies that enable the long-term evolution and adaptability 
    of multimodal systems.
  </p>

  <p>
    Looking ahead, I am committed to advancing the broader vision of 
    <b>Human-centered AI</b>, developing models that not only achieve adaptability 
    and reliability but also foster interpretability and deep alignment with 
    human values and decision-making processes.
